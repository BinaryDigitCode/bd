      <title>Small Web Blogs Compared - Updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember when I said below &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;And don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if I write a new update in 6 months when I change my mind to another service. üòÖ&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;. I&amp;rsquo;m back already updating my post üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found one feature that&amp;rsquo;s turned me off of Bear blog - There is no way to delete images once you upload them. I realize how much I want to upload images easily since I&amp;rsquo;m a visual person and really like sharing photos or cool images of things I like. So I&amp;rsquo;m back on Scribbles to test it since it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to do off of the things and it&amp;rsquo;s free for the moment. I&amp;rsquo;ve also re-enabled tinylitics since it&amp;rsquo;s a neat service and I do like the simple analytics that bear blog had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll update you all next week with different findings as I use more services ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Original Post: 
    &lt;div id=&#34;original-post&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#original-post&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;My Week 
    &lt;div id=&#34;my-week&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#my-week&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week I was reading the 32bit cafe and Mastodon, and made a list of small web platforms that I wanted to try. Ever since I set up WordPress over again, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been happy with the experience. It&amp;rsquo;s bloated and slow, I only wrote a couple of posts, and I kept fiddling with themes and plugins instead of writing. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally a fiddler with code since I love making and changing aethestics of themes and things. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m looking for simple blogging software is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog more, even if they are short random thoughts. I found my old Tumblr and WordPress archives and miss reading about those parts of my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to update Hugo (running on this site) or 11ty for blogging, it&amp;rsquo;s too much work for a short post. I want a decent editor interface, with markdown and abiliity to upload photos and link from my personal gallery or some.pics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be able to enjoy the writing experience with good simple UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be able to change themes and then edit them as I want to - colors, fonts, links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mind spending up to $5-6 a month for a service, as long as I can export it when needed. I want to support the platform and feel that&amp;rsquo;s about what I&amp;rsquo;d pay. I had micro.blog which was great, I love the activitypub integration; but sometimes complicated with theming, also confusing when looking up profiles, and things broke more frequently than I wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Down to Three 
    &lt;div id=&#34;down-to-three&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#down-to-three&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I whittled it down to &lt;a href=&#34;https://scribbles.page/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Scribbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pika.page/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Pika&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bearblog.dev/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Bear&lt;/a&gt;. All services that are specfically made for micro blogging and on the small web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really loved the idea of Scribbles, other blog discoverability, and Vincent is wonderful and responsive, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of the above features that I wanted &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. I will keep afloat on updates to that service for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then signed up for Pika and Bear. I absolutely loved the easy UI of Pika. You sit down, pick a theme color, font, and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go. You are able to adjust CSS as well, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I signed up for Bear, immediately I noticed how much I could customize on the free tier. I&amp;rsquo;m able to not only customize how my blog looks to the reader, but how it look to me in the dashboard CSS! I can add a basic styling to buttons (since by default it&amp;rsquo;s quite &amp;hellip;bareü•Å, and change the fonts and size while in the editor. It helps me tremendously. Herman has clear docs and for the pro plan at $5 a month you add a custom domain, image uploading (on the free tier you can only link from another source which is fine but not always ideal), has analytics (not a big deal for me but might be nice to check), run JS scripts, an email subscriber list (which I may or may not use), and ability to add code to the head and footer. You can also see a disovery list of other Bear blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the winner will be Bear. Pika is also still new, so I will also be keeping an eye out for updates from the team at Good Enough. I love what they do and currently signed up for Letterbird and Album Whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to more updates from both Pika and Scribbles!  And don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if I write a new update in 6 months when I change my mind to another service. üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other small web blog platforms send them my way on &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.lol/@BinaryDigit&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;! Thanks for reading ü•∞&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not a Blogger</title>
      <link>https://binarydigit.cafe/notes/notablog/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://binarydigit.cafe/notes/notablog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know what dawned on me today? After many years of short form &amp;ldquo;blogs&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a blogger. I miss tumblr style/short form content. I don&amp;rsquo;t sit down and write long stories or articles. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed a bit and I think it&amp;rsquo;s why I struggle with fomo and going back and forth to social media and back to my own platforms trying to blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love working on my website, making pages, and aesthetics. For example I signed back up for Tumblr and am so happy browing and reblogging. On Instagram, I usually consume but don&amp;rsquo;t really post, unless it&amp;rsquo;s for streaming or music content. On Mastodon I usually consume, boost, and sometimes post short things. It&amp;rsquo;s just funny how you realize you change after a while. And I don&amp;rsquo;t always need a blog, but when I want to write something I can do it here as a note, which is the whole point of a digital garden, and send it out to socials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a reminder to myself that I can do whatever I want here. That&amp;rsquo;s the whole point of the indieweb and to have fun again online. üíñ&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A personal photo gallery</title>
      <link>https://binarydigit.cafe/notes/chevereto/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to get Chevereto installed on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarydigit.photos/?list=images&amp;amp;sort=date_asc&amp;amp;page=1&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    new domain&lt;/a&gt;! They had a great sale on their one time purchase software, so I grabbed a copy. I wanted some more bells and whistles than their free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this to upload galleries for travel (to share with friends) or blog posts. I still need to upload more to photos Glass, but those photos are edited and curated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this gallery I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded some photos from TwitchCon that just passed. Next up is most likely photos when visiting NY around Christmas. And most likely a dog photo album ü•∞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>My Website Setup</title>
      <link>https://binarydigit.cafe/notes/hugo-setup/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Static Site Generators 
    &lt;div id=&#34;static-site-generators&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#static-site-generators&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ages I resisted static site generators. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wrap my head around the complexity of them, or why I would need one. But then, I got to know the indie web, aka, the small web. The movement of people going back to focus on their own websites, owning a domain name, and publishing content on your website then out to other services, aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    POSSE&lt;/a&gt; - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. I always wanted to keep that motto all these years, but kept jumping around from a social blog to another social blog, to Wordpress, and back.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve landed on micro.blog, but even want to avoid using that in the future if I can help it. It helps save a few bucks a month as well as learn the intricacies of static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Tinkering 
    &lt;div id=&#34;tinkering&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#tinkering&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since micro.blog is built with Hugo, I went back to trying to learn it. I first edited my micro.blog theme with the custom editor, and then decided to give Hugo a try on my own. Lo and behold, it finally &amp;ldquo;clicked&amp;rdquo;. I tried a couple of themes, and then landed upton this one, named &lt;a href=&#34;https://blowfish.page/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Blowfish&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;so awesome&lt;/em&gt;! It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly customizable and helped me learn so many details about Hugo. I then was able to push my git repo to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Netlify&lt;/a&gt; and have it hosted there for free! I&amp;rsquo;m super happy that I&amp;rsquo;m able to finally have a digital garden (cafe) and blog on my own domain, not worried about a major service going down, an acquisition, or paying a ton of money for hosting each month. I hope I can keep it running for a while and never go back to hosting again (unless they offer something that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist). Next up, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to import old posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to my Digital Cafe</title>
      <link>https://binarydigit.cafe/notes/hello/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://binarydigit.cafe/notes/hello/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my attempt at a new site with Hugo, finally, on my own domain and hosted via netlify/github! I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to do many things here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add webmentions, since ideally that would be the way folks respond or comment to my self hosted blog. I really like the fediverse and the small web, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve installed this correctly. If not I&amp;rsquo;ll keep trying :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added back the CS.SJoy.lol webring, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to set up the Indieweb web ring (first I need to finish some auth specs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love how to figure out how to import existing blog posts from my micro.blog, so eventually I can keep everything here. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is possible, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge deal anyway if I can get everything set up properly. I can restart a blog at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
