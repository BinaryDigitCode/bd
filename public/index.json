I\u0026rsquo;m back already updating my post 😂\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found one feature that\u0026rsquo;s turned me off of Bear blog - There is no way to delete images once you upload them. I realize how much I want to upload images easily since I\u0026rsquo;m a visual person and really like sharing photos or cool images of things I like. So I\u0026rsquo;m back on Scribbles to test it since it\u0026rsquo;s super easy to do off of the things and it\u0026rsquo;s free for the moment. I\u0026rsquo;ve also re-enabled tinylitics since it\u0026rsquo;s a neat service and I do like the simple analytics that bear blog had.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll update you all next week with different findings as I use more services 🤣\nOriginal Post: # My Week # During the week I was reading the 32bit cafe and Mastodon, and made a list of small web platforms that I wanted to try. Ever since I set up WordPress over again, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been happy with the experience. It\u0026rsquo;s bloated and slow, I only wrote a couple of posts, and I kept fiddling with themes and plugins instead of writing. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally a fiddler with code since I love making and changing aethestics of themes and things. The reason I\u0026rsquo;m looking for simple blogging software is to:\nBlog more, even if they are short random thoughts. I found my old Tumblr and WordPress archives and miss reading about those parts of my life. I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to update Hugo (running on this site) or 11ty for blogging, it\u0026rsquo;s too much work for a short post. I want a decent editor interface, with markdown and abiliity to upload photos and link from my personal gallery or some.pics. I want to be able to enjoy the writing experience with good simple UI I want to be able to change themes and then edit them as I want to - colors, fonts, links. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending up to $5-6 a month for a service, as long as I can export it when needed. I want to support the platform and feel that\u0026rsquo;s about what I\u0026rsquo;d pay. I had micro.blog which was great, I love the activitypub integration; but sometimes complicated with theming, also confusing when looking up profiles, and things broke more frequently than I wanted. Down to Three # I whittled it down to Scribbles, Pika, and Bear. All services that are specfically made for micro blogging and on the small web.\nI really loved the idea of Scribbles, other blog discoverability, and Vincent is wonderful and responsive, it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough of the above features that I wanted right now. I will keep afloat on updates to that service for sure!\nI then signed up for Pika and Bear. I absolutely loved the easy UI of Pika. You sit down, pick a theme color, font, and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go. You are able to adjust CSS as well, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much to change.\nWhen I signed up for Bear, immediately I noticed how much I could customize on the free tier. I\u0026rsquo;m able to not only customize how my blog looks to the reader, but how it look to me in the dashboard CSS! I can add a basic styling to buttons (since by default it\u0026rsquo;s quite \u0026hellip;bare🥁, and change the fonts and size while in the editor. It helps me tremendously. Herman has clear docs and for the pro plan at $5 a month you add a custom domain, image uploading (on the free tier you can only link from another source which is fine but not always ideal), has analytics (not a big deal for me but might be nice to check), run JS scripts, an email subscriber list (which I may or may not use), and ability to add code to the head and footer. You can also see a disovery list of other Bear blogs.\nFor me, the winner will be Bear. Pika is also still new, so I will also be keeping an eye out for updates from the team at Good Enough. I love what they do and currently signed up for Letterbird and Album Whale.\nI look forward to more updates from both Pika and Scribbles! And don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I write a new update in 6 months when I change my mind to another service. 😅\nIf you have any other small web blog platforms send them my way on Mastodon!

Extremely frustrating. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it back and support was abismal. I was sad about, but also was already on my way off that platform by deleting my images.

It was very easy, hardly any configuration needed, I was able to set up custom domain name, and it was cheap. The minimum specs that were enough for me to run a server is about $1.90 a month. I decided on this method rather then manually pushing to Codeberg since they don\u0026rsquo;t offer repo mirroring due to performance issues. I didn\u0026rsquo;t look up if Gitlab or Sourcehut do mirroring but this is better.\nGitea in the Cafe If I have the energy and patience I might make a small Gitea or Forgejo instance on my Raspberry Pi since it\u0026rsquo;s for backup, but this is perfect for now.\n","date":"Feb 6 2024","permalink":"/notes/gitea-cafe/","section":"Notes and Ideas","summary":"I saw the news that the co-founder of Github was banned via Hacker News - tweet here.","title":"Gitea for the Cafe"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 6 2024","permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tech"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 4 2024","permalink":"/tags/nostalgia/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"nostalgia"},{"content":"I love waking up in the mornings, making a cup of coffee, and seeing what Twitch streams are online.
