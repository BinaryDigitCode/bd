### A Personal Photo Gallery

I've set up a photo gallery for snapshots using [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) over at [binarydigit.photos](https://binarydigit.photos). This is for personal photos and galleries, not a porfolio site.

### Livestreaming on Twitch

I livestream music mixes and gameplay on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about). I'm working on a tiny "studio" at home so I can stream consistently - a big goal this year.

### This Personal Website

Iâ€™ve set up this fun website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme which is incredibly customizable and has so many features. This is my digital garden where I'll write notes and thoughts.

### My Professonal Website

Also built on Hugo and Blowfish, I've created a username [LizPixels](https://lizpixels.com), that I feel works better for a "more professional" prescence on the web, seperate to my hobbies here. I'll see if I end up using it at all, but for now I hope to make it a site focused on my professional experiences and new things I'd like to learn.
