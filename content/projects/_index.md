### This Personal Website

Iâ€™ve set up this fun website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme which is incredibly customizable and has so many features. This is my digital garden where I'll write notes and thoughts.

### Micro blogging

I've invested into micro.blog premium so that I can create a few blogs/sites instead of manually updating my static site generators.

### Streaming website

I livestream music mixes and variety of gameplay on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about), and I've decided to create a website for all my updates on stream, music uploads, and video uploads :D You can bookmark or subscribe to the RSS feed at [binarydigit.stream](https://binarydigit.stream).


### DJ Mixes

I'm trying out [HearThis.at](https://hearthis.at/binarydigitdj) for a while instead of uploading to SoundCloud Pro. These uploads will be for others to enjoy mixes that I've done on Twitch or offline.

I'd like to make a website dedicated to my my creative yet professional discovery of self. I'm not sure where I'm going with this yet so we'll see if I continue it.
