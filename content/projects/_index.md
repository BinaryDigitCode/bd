### This Personal Website

Iâ€™ve set up this fun website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme which is incredibly customizable and has so many features. This is my digital garden where I'll write notes and thoughts.


### Livestreaming on Twitch

I livestream music mixes and gameplay on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about). I'm working on a tiny "studio" at home so I can stream consistently - a big goal this year.


### DJ Mix Uploads

I'm trying out [HearThis.at](https://hearthis.at/binarydigitdj) for a while instead of uploading to SoundCloud since it's so pricey, and I don't produce my own audio anyway. These uploads will be for others to enjoy mixes that I've done on Twitch or offline.

### Caffeine and Code

Also built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and with the [Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo) theme, I'd like to make this website dedicated to my coding projects and more "professional" prescence on the web.
