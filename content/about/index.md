## About Me

<img src="BinaryDigit.png" alt="BinaryDigit graphic with colorful background" width="100%"/>

I’m B (aka Liz), a Xennial who grew up when the internet was young, just as I was. My family bought our first computer in 1997, and I become fascinated with how computers worked, how the web evolved, and being online a bit too much!

I'm originally from New York and currently living in Michigan. My work background is in tech (I was a systems engineer, part time web dev, and now a manager). I would love to find more diverse folks in gaming, tech, music and all things creative. I love to travel, take photos, game on my PC, PS5 and Switch, stream, tweak code and always learning something new. ✨

I’m doing a digital overhaul for the next few months and would like to make this site a digital garden, or in my case, a _digital cafe_; a personal space to gather projects, what I'm working on, thoughts, and notes.
