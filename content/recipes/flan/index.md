## Ingredients

- ~1/2 cup sugar to caramelize
- 1 can condensed milk
- 1 can evaporated milk
- 6 eggs
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup milk
- pinch of salt
- add to blender

## Steps

1. Heat sugar in small pan on medium-high heat with 1/2 teaspoon of water. Stir occasionally until sugar melts and is a golden color. Remove from heat as it will still be melting.

2. Pour into an oven safe pyrex dish or baking pan

3. Bake in a water bath at 350°F until a knife can cut through it cleanly (or what my mom calls “a little wiggle on top” 💓)

4. When ready to serve, flip into deep service dish or pan

5. Cool in fridge for a few hours or ideally, overnight
